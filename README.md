# Insufficient Error Handling in MongoDB Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB Node.js driver usage and provides a solution.

**Problem:** The provided code snippet showcases inadequate error handling for asynchronous MongoDB operations.  While it logs errors to the console, it doesn't implement robust error handling mechanisms. This can cause unhandled rejections and application instability.

**Solution:** The solution shows proper error handling using try...catch blocks and explicit handling of potential exceptions.  It prevents crashes and allows for a graceful degradation of the application, providing more resilience.
